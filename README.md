* There are a total of 86 months included in the data set
* The net total amount is $38,382,578
* The average changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period is $-2315.12

## Challenge 2: PyPoll

![Vote Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)

### **Overview of Project**

In this challenge, I've been tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. I'll need to report on the total number of votes cast, the total number and percentage of votes cast for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. The purpose of this project is not only to audit this recent election, but create a script that can be used to report on elections as a whole.

### **Results**
Based on the election analysis, I can report that:
* There were a total of 3,521,001 total votes cast in the election
* Candidate Results:
  * Khan received 63% of the votes cast, a total of 2,218,231 votes
  * Correy received 20% of the votes cast, a total of 704,200 votes
  * Li received 14% of the votes cast, a total of 492,940 votes
  O'Tooley received 3% of the votes cast, a total of 105,630 votes
* The winner of the election was Khan
